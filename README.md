 ðŸ§  How It Works

 HTML (`index.html`)
- Lays out the calculator interface using a combination of `<input>` and `<button>` elements.
- Buttons are linked to JavaScript functions using `onclick` attributes.

ðŸŽ¨ CSS (`styles.css`)
- Applies a modern dark theme.
- Uses **Flexbox** to center the calculator on screen.
- Organizes buttons in a **4-column grid**.
- Adds hover and press animations for better UX.

ðŸ§® JavaScript (`script.js`)
Contains all calculator logic:

 `appendToDisplay(value)`
- Adds a number/operator to the display.

 `clearDisplay()`
- Clears the entire display.

 `deleteLast()`
- Deletes the last entered character.

 `calculateResult()`
- Evaluates the expression using `eval()` (with `try/catch` for error handling).
